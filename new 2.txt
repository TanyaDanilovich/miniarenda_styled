Design a website for mini-excavator rentals with an operator.
Main design colors: orange (the primary color for highlighting key elements, buttons, and headings) and blue (the secondary color for backgrounds, links, and minor elements). The design should be created for both dark and light themes. Navigation should be as simple as possible, and all pages should include CTA buttons (Call to Action) with prompts like "Order" or "Call." There should be a theme switch button for toggling between light and dark modes. Additionally, include a language switch button for Russian and Belarusian. The design should be modern, clean, and responsive for mobile devices. Special attention should be given to website loading speed and mobile responsiveness.
